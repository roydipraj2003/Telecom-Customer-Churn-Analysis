# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project focuses on analyzing a real-world telecom customer dataset to identify key factors influencing customer churn using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

🗂 Dataset Description

Total records: 2,000+ customers

Total features: 16

Data includes:

Customer demographics

Subscription details

Service usage information

Churn status (Yes/No)

🔍 Key Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw telecom customer data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Analyze churn patterns across different customer segments

Visualize insights using multiple chart types

Identify factors contributing to customer churn

🛠 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Corrected data types

Removed unnecessary columns

Prepared data for analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn distribution

Compared churn behavior across categorical and numerical features

Studied relationships between variables

3. Data Visualization

The following plots were used to gain insights:

Bar Plots
To compare churn across categorical variables such as contract type and services.

Pie Charts
To visualize the overall percentage distribution of churned vs retained customers.

Histograms
To analyze distributions of numerical features like tenure and monthly charges.

Correlation Heatmap
To identify relationships between numerical variables and understand feature correlations.

📈 Key Insights

Customers with shorter tenure showed higher churn rates

Certain contract types had significantly higher churn

Monthly charges and tenure were important factors influencing churn behavior
