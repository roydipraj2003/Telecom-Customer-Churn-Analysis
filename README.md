# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
 
## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most vital metrics for telecom companies. Since acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one, understanding why customers leave is crucial for long-term profitability.

This project analyzes a telecom dataset to uncover the drivers behind customer attrition. Using Python, EDA, and Statistical Visualization, I’ve identified the "red flags" that signal a customer is likely to leave.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
Clean & Preprocess: Transform raw data into an analysis-ready format.

Identify Patterns: Determine which customer segments (contract types, demographics) are most at risk.

Visual Storytelling: Use data visualization to make complex trends easy for stakeholders to understand.

Actionable Insights: Provide data-driven recommendations for retention strategies.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings
During the analysis, the following trends were identified:

Contract Sensitivity: Customers on Month-to-Month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those on one or two-year plans.

Tenure Impact: Most churn occurs within the first 6 months of the customer lifecycle.

Financial Drivers: High Monthly Charges were positively correlated with churn, suggesting price sensitivity in certain segments.

## 🎯 Business Use Case
This analysis provides the Marketing and Customer Success teams with a roadmap to:

Target "At-Risk" customers with personalized loyalty offers.

Adjust pricing strategies for high-churn service tiers.

Improve onboarding during the critical first 6 months to increase lifetime value (LTV).

## 📌 Future Enhancements
[ ] Develop a Predictive Machine Learning Model (Random Forest/XGBoost).

[ ] Create an interactive Tableau or Power BI Dashboard.

[ ] Perform Feature Engineering to create a "Risk Score" for every customer.
